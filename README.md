# Blogger App Store

A modern, responsive, static App Store website that uses Blogger (Blogspot) as a headless CMS. Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+).

## Features
- Fetches app data from your Blogger blog using its RSS feed
- Fully static, no backend required
- Responsive design with modern UI
- Category and app detail pages
- Uses a CORS proxy for Blogger feed access

## How to Use

1. **Configure Your Blogger Blog**
   - Create posts for each app in your Blogger blog.
   - Use the Blogger "Labels" feature for categories (e.g., Social, Games).
   - In each post, switch to HTML view and use this structure:

     ```html
     <div id="app_description">
         <p>Full app description here.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="app-data" style="display:none;">
         <div id="download_link">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.app</div>
         <div id="icon_url">https://example.com/icon.png</div>
         <div id="version">v1.2.3</div>
         <div id="developer">Awesome Dev Inc.</div>
         <div id="screenshots">
             <img src="https://example.com/screenshot1.png" alt="Screenshot 1">
             <img src="https://example.com/screenshot2.png" alt="Screenshot 2">
         </div>
     </div>
     ```

2. **Set Your Blogger URL**
   - In `js/script.js`, set the `BLOG_URL` constant to your blog's URL (already set for you).

3. **Run the App Store**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser. (For best results, use a local server or deploy to Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)

4. **Browse Apps**
   - The homepage lists all apps.
   - Click categories or app cards to view details.

## Troubleshooting
- If apps do not load, check your browser console for errors.
- Make sure your Blogger blog is public and has posts with the correct structure.
- The CORS proxy (https://corsproxy.io) is used to fetch the feed. If it is blocked, try another proxy or deploy your own.

## Customization
- Edit `css/style.css` for styles.
- Edit `js/script.js` for logic or to add features.
